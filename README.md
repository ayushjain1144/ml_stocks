In his project we try to predict whether a company may underperform or outperform the market using machine learning.
The datasets are obtained from quandl. The datasets were basically yahoo finance webpages.
Two types of datasets are used: Index prices of companies, S&P500 values.
For this project I used SVM models. I tried and implemented both the linear SVM and gaussian SVM.
As expected gaussian SVM performed better than linear SVM. 
Used Stratified K fold for cross validation purpose to choose C.
